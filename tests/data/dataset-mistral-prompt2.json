OTOH`, `requireExplicitBindings(Class...)` would be a targeted measure, and can be sidestepped by not including that module that requires explicit bindings for that class, or by including a `bind(ThatClass.class)` statement, which defeats the initial goal of \"don't let people use the <this type>\".\r\n  *  Guice has since added a @RestrictedBindingSource annotation (see https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/RestrictedBindingSource), which feels like it's slightly better suited for your use-case of wanting to prevent people from using the \"wrong\" type. Unfortunately, @RestrictedBindingSource doesn't apply to your use-case, because it's intended as an annotation to prevent folks from _binding_ things, as opposed to preventing folks from _using_ things. It's also limited to restricted types you own, because the type or qualifier itself has to be annotated. However, I could imagine extending @RestrictedBindingSource to support some kind of Binder integration, like `binder.restrictBindingSource(RestrictionInfo, ClassOrAnnotation...)`, or something similar to that, which could potentially prevent usage + other bindings. This may not make sense, though, because folks could just bind the types by removing that module altogether.\r\n  * Overall, this feels like something that's better suited to a test: use the [Guice SPI](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/ExtendingGuice) to iterate over what's injected and confirm that no \"bad\" types are used.",

It's very common for these applications to bump up against their committed limits and either `gc` themselves back down or increase the committed limit to approach the maximum, neither of which would trigger a `DOWN` status.

While a seekbar + current position and duration, like commonly used for VOD, is like you say not suited for live streams, a different style of seekbar can be a good solution for live streams. One use case is live TV, for channels with programs starting at specific times. \n\nThere are, I believe, two main ways of doing a live seekbar. In both cases the duration is not displayed, only the position. The position label can either be the offset from the live edge position, for example \"-31:05\", or (preferably) it can be the wall clock time associated with that position in the stream, for example \"11:37:45\". The wall clock time value can be calculated from the HLS' tag PROGRAM-DATE-TIME. If that tag is missing, an approximation can be made based on the time on the device when the live playlist was downloaded. This way, the seekbar can be used to, for example, find position \"11:30\", when a certain TV program starts. \n\nI suggest this behavior for ExoPlayer HLS-live: to include a working seekbar, and to display \"Live\" in the duration label and the wall clock time, like described above, in the position label. The wall clock time associated with the current position can be calculated by determining the wall clock time when the stream starts (start of first chunk), and adding the elapsed time since the start. \n",

For example, the change to how the plugin classpath looks like a good thing to do, but it's unrelated to applying Kotlin examples in the documentation. It's also confusing to me in its current form as sometimes the classpath is configured in the test, and sometimes the classpath is configured in the build script.

This would align them with the approach that's been taken in the integration tests where `GradleCompatibilitySuite` is used to run against different versions of Gradle. The suite would run the tests using both a `.gradle` file and a `.gradle.kts` file and would avoid the need for creating a separate test class for testing the two languages for each example.\r\n\r\n",

This PR is now dependant on #9421.\r\n\r\n> This change feels a bit more controversial to me, because I think this kind of stream property change should trigger the start of a new Period in a DASH manifest, and the inclusion of an EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY with a fresh EXT-X-MAP in an HLS media playlist. I suspect (but did not confirm for HLS) that ExoPlayer handles the pixel aspect ratio change correctly if the manifest level signalling is present.\r\n\r\nI did some tests before working on this PR and `EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` does currently not suffice to make ExoPlayer notice the aspect ratio change. For Apple AVKit and VLC, a discontinuity is sufficient, but required to make the aspect ratio change get noticed. And FFmpeg/FFplay notices the aspect ratio changes even without discontinuities.\r\n\r\nRFC8216 [says about this](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216#section-4.3.2.3):\r\n>  The EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY tag SHOULD be present if there is a change in\r\n   any of the following characteristics:\r\n> - encoding parameters\r\n> - encoding sequence\r\n\r\nSo at least to my understanding, a discontinuity is not strictly required in this case. And my opinion is that, if it doesn't cause any issues on the player side, why not make PAR changes just work out of the box, even without discontinuities?\r\n\r\nThis would at least make the stream creation easier. e.g. in my case, I had to write a patch (https://github.com/google/shaka-packager/pull/976) for shaka-packager to make it insert these discontinuities because Apples player requires them. But even then the switches are still not as smooth as with FFmpeg/FFplay (and thanks to this PR with ExoPlayer, too) because the segment cuts might not happen exactly where the aspect ratio change occurs. And fixing this will require even more effort and complexity on the stream-creation side.\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, I highly prefer how FFmpeg does it because it's way less of a burden to get it to work and I don't see a reason not to support this.",

I tested just the method `cache.saveRequest(request, response)` with 100,000,000 iterations, and ran the test a number of times before and after the code change. The request that was saved included 4 headers, 4 cookies, 4 preferred locales and 4 parameters, causing the constructor to do some work on each iteration.\r\n\r\nThere were no discernible differences with the default configuration for `HttpSessionRequestCache`. However, with `cache.setCreateSessionAllowed(false)`:\r\n\r\nBefore code change:\r\n\r\n* Average ~1,464 nanoseconds per `saveRequest`\r\n\r\nAfter code change:\r\n\r\n* Average ~114 nanoseconds per `saveRequest`\r\n\r\nSo we save about 1.35 microseconds per request. This is pretty small, but proves that the performance impact is non-negligible. It's worth noting that most applications would use the `NullRequestCache` in the stateless scenario (`sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)` or even `SessionCreationPolicy.NEVER`), so I'm not sure many applications will benefit from this. Still, this is another way to configure the application to avoid session creation when desired and may improve performance in that case.",

Upon using core reflection of a class, the JVM always eagerly asserts the consistency of a type. It does not matter if `getField`, `getDeclaredField` or any other method is called. The JVM does not allow the use of reflection on an invalidly linked class.\n\n> This is clearly false.  The JVM has no problem whatsoever with the signature of BeanDefinitionLoader when it's used as intended. \n\nIt does have a problem with it, therefore the `NoClassDefFoundError` is emitted upon linking the Spring Boot class. The only reason that it works today is the fact that HotSpot links types lazily as suggested in [JVMS §5.4](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.5):\n\n> For example, a Java Virtual Machine implementation may choose to resolve each symbolic reference in a class or interface individually when it is used (\"lazy\" or \"late\" resolution), or to resolve them all at once when the class is being verified (\"eager\" or \"static\" resolution). This means that the resolution process may continue, in some implementations, after a class or interface has been initialized. Whichever strategy is followed, any error detected during resolution must be thrown at a point in the program that (directly or indirectly) uses a symbolic reference to the class or interface. \n\nAt the same time, the JVMS does not give any guarantees about lazy resolution. Spring Boot does therefore violate the specification and would not work on a spec-confirmant VM that applies eager linkage. Furthermore, with project Jigsaw in place, the module verification step would trigger a full linkage even without any third-party interaction. You are coding against the implementation, not the specification. This does not make this a legal pattern to be applied on the JVM, this goes for the current implementation as for the suggested `GroovyReader` alternative. Strictly speaking, only reflective access of optional types is a legal pattern. This is also how Byte Buddy implements it itself to function on Android where linkage is applied eagerly.\n\n> In short, you're using an internal class in a way that was never intended.\n\nNeither the instrumentation or reflection APIs are explicitly bound to visibility scopes. A good example for this behavior is the usage of reflection by the Spring framework itself. Ironically, your own framework could not \"work-arround\" such a limitation if other people impelented a patter as the one that you suggest. As for reflection, only access of non-visible members is guarded and checked by a `SecurityManager`. And even if this was true, if you ever declared a public subclass or implemented a public interface of the class in question, calling `getField` on this class would result in the same error.\n\nThis is a bug in Spring Boot.\n",

We might convert some of ours as well. We're committed to making ExoPlayer easy to use from Kotlin (hence all of the nullness annotation work we've undertaken). It's unclear how this is directly related to what language we develop the core library in, however.\r\n\r\n> What exactly is very painful about bundling the Kotlin runtime? Is it because of method count/APK size as described in OkHttp's thread? Proguard and D8/R8 can help slimming the impact in these metrics, stripping out unused code. I'd also like to point that given OkHttp's move to Kotlin sources, that means at least part of the consumers of ExoPlayer already bundle the runtime within their apps; certainly most of the users of the OkHttp extension.\r\n\r\nYes, that's the main pain point. And yes, it's correct that those using OkHttp 4 will already be pulling it in. That's why OkHttp 4 adoption is a good data point for us to keep an eye on. Regarding the ExoPlayer OkHttp extension specifically, I can say that adoption is tiny relative to adoption of the core library.\r\n\r\n> I'd like to add that the proposal in this PR is to include Kotlin in test-sources only for now, which also means it isn't code that will be delivered to the final production APKs of app developers.\r\n\r\nThere's no technical reason not to use Kotlin for tests, but I don't agree that it's beneficial to do so. It effectively requires developers to understand two languages before they can do anything, rather than one. I think there needs to be a bigger payoff than being able to use Kotlin syntax in test code for that to be worthwhile.\r\n\r\n> It will be a good playground for the maintainer team to get familiar with the extra tools for modeling and API-design; besides making the codebase friendlier for newcomers overall.\r\n\r\nThis argument gets floated a lot for tooling that might make the development team's job a bit easier. You can make a similar argument for _insert your favourite dependency injection framework here_, AutoValue, other annotation processors and so on. If you're developing an app then this argument often makes sense, but the same is not so true when you're developing a widely used open source library that a large number of developers from different companies need to dip in and out of. The more tools we use, the harder it is for developers to do this. Some development inefficiency on our side is a price worth paying for keeping the code accessible to the widest group of external developers. This doesn't mean that we we'll never adopt additional tooling, but it does mean that the bar for adoption is significantly higher than it would be were we developing an app.\r\n\r\n> I have a good example of diff that would have been way less painful to produce given some features that Java unfortunately does not yet provide, like default parameters, value objects and copy constructors.\r\n\r\nThe `Format` class has grown into a bit of a mess, and adding a new field is indeed very painful at the moment. However it's a stretch to say that Kotlin features are important for fixing it. There are ways to rewrite `Format` in Java that would also solve the problem.

        "raw_message": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nMEP22 was intended to provide a way to customize user interactions,\r\nin particular with the toolbar via the implementation to \"tools\".  In\r\npractice, it remains currently difficult to add general customizations;\r\nfor example, the color-vision deficiency simulator recently proposed\r\ndoes not fit in the MEP22 framework.

        "clean_message": "PR Summary MEP22 was intended to provide a way to customize user interactions, in particular with the toolbar via the implementation to \"tools\".  In practice, it remains currently difficult to add general customizations; for example, the color-vision deficiency simulator recently proposed does not fit in the MEP22 framework.  Moreover, there is no way to register MEP22 tools to be added to all figures. This patch proposes an alternative approach for toolbar customization: it adds a rcParam () which is a list of callables (actually, of \"modulename:functioname\" strings, so that they can be specified in the matplotlibrc file) that get called whenever plt.figure() creates a figure is instantiated; each of the callable gets the figure as parameter and can modify it as it sees fit (note that it is equivalent to pass the figure or the toolbar as parameter, as one can reach one from the other; passing the figure was deemed nicer). This makes it easy to distribute such customizations as plain python modules than can be installed from PyPI.  Also note that figure hooks are intentionally not applied when figures are created without going through  -- when embedding, one can easily explicitly call the hooks directly on the figure (this is one reason why passing the figure is nicer than passing the toolbar). As an example, the color-vision deficiency simulator is modified to use this hook (see docstring of the  example). The advantage of this approach is that arbitrary modifications to the toolbar become possible (here, adding a menu-in-a-toolbar), but this naturally means that each GUI toolkit needs its own code.  Likely we will need to provide \"template\" implementations that can be copied by third-parties.  (There is also some functionality currently only available as private API, as mentioned in comments; one such API is , which provides theme-dependent icon recolorization.  These APIs should be made public in some form, but that should be doable.) (One should check to what extent this approach is generalizable to the macos and notebook backends -- customizations to the former could possibly be implemented via PyObjC(?), and the latter via js injection?)

For example,\r\n          ``{'a': 'b', 'y': 'z'}`` replaces the value 'a' with 'b' and\r\n          'y' with 'z'. To use a dict in this way the `value`\r\n          parameter should be `None`.\r\n        - For a DataFrame a dict can specify that different values\r\n          should be replaced in different columns. For example,\r\n          ``{'a': 1, 'b': 'z'}`` looks for the value 1 in column 'a'\r\n          and the value 'z' in column 'b' and replaces these values\r\n          with whatever is specified in `value`. The `value` parameter\r\n          should not be ``None`` in this case. You can treat this as a\r\n          special case of passing two lists except that you are\r\n          specifying the column to search in.\r\n        - For a DataFrame nested dictionaries, e.g.,\r\n          ``{'a': {'b': np.nan}}``, are read as follows: look in column\r\n          'a' for the value 'b' and replace it with NaN. The `value`\r\n          parameter should be ``None`` to use a nested dict in this\r\n          way. You can nest regular expressions as well. Note that\r\n          column names (the top-level dictionary keys in a nested\r\n          dictionary) **cannot** be regular expressions.\r\n\r\n    * None:\r\n\r\n        - This means that the `regex` argument must be a string,\r\n          compiled regular expression, or list, dict, ndarray or\r\n          Series of such elements. If `value` is also ``None`` then\r\n          this **must** be a nested dictionary or Series.\r\n\r\n    See the examples section for examples of each of these.\r\nvalue : scalar, dict, list, str, regex, default None\r\n    Value to replace any values matching `to_replace` with.\r\n    For a DataFrame a dict of values can be used to specify which\r\n    value to use for each column (columns not in the dict will not be\r\n    filled). Regular expressions, strings and lists or dicts of such\r\n    objects are also allowed.\r\ninplace : boolean, default False\r\n    If True, in place. Note: this will modify any\r\n    other views on this object (e.g. a column from a DataFrame).\r\n    Returns the caller if this is True.\r\nlimit : int, default None\r\n    Maximum size gap to forward or backward fill.\r\nregex : bool or same types as `to_replace`, default False\r\n    Whether to interpret `to_replace` and/or `value` as regular\r\n    expressions. If this is ``True`` then `to_replace` *must* be a\r\n    string. Alternatively, this could be a regular expression or a\r\n    list, dict, or array of regular expressions in which case\r\n    `to_replace` must be ``None``.\r\nmethod : {'pad', 'ffill', 'bfill', `None`}\r\n    The method to use when for replacement, when `to_replace` is a\r\n    scalar, list or tuple and `value` is ``None``.\r\n\r\n    .. versionchanged:: 0.23.0\r\n        Added to DataFrame.\r\naxis : None\r\n    Deprecated.\r\n\r\nSee Also\r\n--------\r\nDataFrame.fillna : Fill `NaN` values\r\nDataFrame.where : Replace values based on boolean condition\r\nSeries.str.replace : Simple string replacement.\r\n\r\nReturns\r\n-------\r\nDataFrame\r\n    Object after replacement.\r\n\r\nRaises\r\n------\r\nAssertionError\r\n    * If `regex` is not a ``bool`` and `to_replace` is not\r\n      ``None``.\r\nTypeError\r\n    * If `to_replace` is a ``dict`` and `value` is not a ``list``,\r\n      ``dict``, ``ndarray``, or ``Series``\r\n    * If `to_replace` is ``None`` and `regex` is not compilable\r\n      into a regular expression or is a list, dict, ndarray, or\r\n      Series.\r\n    * When replacing multiple ``bool`` or ``datetime64`` objects and\r\n      the arguments to `to_replace` does not match the type of the\r\n      value being replaced\r\nValueError\r\n    * If a ``list`` or an ``ndarray`` is passed to `to_replace` and\r\n      `value` but they are not the same length.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n* Regex substitution is performed under the hood with ``re.sub``. The\r\n  rules for substitution for ``re.sub`` are the same.\r\n* Regular expressions will only substitute on strings, meaning you\r\n  cannot provide, for example, a regular expression matching floating\r\n  point numbers and expect the columns in your frame that have a\r\n  numeric dtype to be matched. However, if those floating point\r\n  numbers *are* strings, then you can do this.\r\n* This method has *a lot* of options. You are encouraged to experiment\r\n  and play with this method to gain intuition about how it works.\r\n* When dict is used as the `to_replace` value, it is like\r\n  key(s) in the dict are the to_replace part and\r\n  value(s) in the dict are the value parameter.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\n**Scalar `to_replace` and `value`**\r\n\r\n>>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])\r\n>>> s.replace(0, 5)\r\n0    5\r\n1    1\r\n2    2\r\n3    3\r\n4    4\r\ndtype: int64\r\n\r\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\r\n...

In a `ts` file, `import puppeteer from 'puppeteer'`\r\n1. In a `ts` file, `import type {ElementHandle} from 'puppeteer'`\r\n1. In a `ts` file, referencing a type as `puppeteer.ElementHandle`\r\n1.

However, what the `types.d.ts`\r\nfile doesn't do out of the box is declare the default export, so\r\nimporting Puppeteer's default export to call a method such as `launch`\r\non it will get you an error.\r\n\r\nThat's where the `script/add-default-export-to-types.ts` comes in. It\r\nappends the following to the auto-generated `types.d.ts` file:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare const puppeteer: PuppeteerNode;\r\nexport = puppeteer;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tells TypeScript what the default export is, and by using the\r\n`export =` syntax, we make sure TS understands both in a TS ESM\r\nenvironment and in a JS CJS environment.\r\n\r\nNow the `build` step, which is run by GitHub Actions when we release,\r\nwill generate the `.d.ts` file and then extend it with the default\r\nexport code.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that I was generating a valid package, I created a new\r\nrepository locally with the two code samples linked in Gists above.

I got started on this project as a means of making the `Angular CLI` run under bazel more or less without any special customization. The Angular CLI is capable of running jest when using the `@nrwl/jest` package that my company I work for maintains. And in addition to that, I just like jest and want it to be the defacto test runner for running JS tests under bazel.\r\n\r\n@cpojer One question. I'm willing to augment `watchmen` to have the same behavior if need be (it doesn't affect the bazel use case, but if its a requirement for getting the PR merged I could be persuaded to make a PR). So my question to you is, is that a hard requirement for getting this logic merged? Could it be made to be follow up work after merging this PR?",
        "clean_message": "Sorry for the late reply, I went on a vacation last week :) This isn't directly related to Google's adoption of a new test runner (I don't work there anymore so I'm a bit out of the loop). I got started on this project as a means of making the  run under bazel more or less without any special customization. The Angular CLI is capable of running jest when using the  package that my company I work for maintains. And in addition to that, I just like jest and want it to be the defacto test runner for running JS tests under bazel. One question.

Here's an example REPL that changes the src attribute every few seconds. It polls the complete attribute so you can see it change back to false while the new image is loading.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we need this to be able to sense `complete` becoming `false` again upon another `src` beginning to be loaded into the `<img>`. I think specifically this happens as soon as you set the `src` on the `<img>`, but it may also require that the `<img>` be mounted in the DOM at the time and with `display` value other than `none` – needs confirming. I also don't know whether all occurrences of setting the `src` attribute would result in a load action, or whether there are cases such as, given an existing `<img src=\"//img.png\" />`, assigning `img.src = \"/img.png\";` might simply no-op, for example.\r\n\r\nMy intention in opening the original issue was that this two-way binding could be used to make it easier to build re-usable carousel components. Imagine a Netflix-style app, where there is a single carousel (consisting of a sequence of `<img>` elements) that gets reused when you move up/down to go from, say, the \"Featured\" section, to the \"Watch again\" section. As one moves between sections, the `src` attribute would be updated on each `<img>` element and their `complete` states would update accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhat this makes possible: My plan for this two-way binding was that when any image were not in `complete` state, we could show some kind of placeholder, rather than viewers having to watch an incomplete image load in bit-by-bit. So when moving from category to category, the whole carousel would be placeholders briefly, and one-by-one, the images would load in and we'd be able to declaratively remove the placeholders as each image loads.\r\n\r\nThe implementation as-is has a dead-end lifecycle and needs to cover the whole lifecycle of an `<img>` to be useful in practice, given that Svelte will of course reuse an existing `<img>` element if the only change is an attribute change.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the whole lifecycle: Bear in mind the possibility of the \"error\" event during load as well, in case it makes a difference, e.g. allows you to remove the \"load\" listener until the next `src` attribute update comes in.",

I believe these problems would go away if you did unit conversions *after* any arithmetical operations.

Since it’s saved in the test definition, we can see by inspection that the backward accuracy for conv2d (on GPU) is a bit lower than desired. It’s probably a compounded truncation error since there are so many nested loops and we are working with 32 bit precision on the GPU.\r\n> \r\n> I agree with you, but that still doesn't fix the flakiness of the test, which is a bigger problem than setting the precision. It's OK the test to fail, but when I'm running multiple times on the same machine and get different results, that makes developing hard.\r\n\r\nDoes grad_rtol need to be further relaxed then? Having a test that passes every time with known accuracy expectations is better than one that passes sometimes with strict accuracy expectations. Or is there some other issue?\r\n\r\nI remember actually relaxing the grad tolerance for the GPU conv2d test to 1e-5 or 1e-4 before, but that change may have been clobbered by a recent PR by mistake.

I think the .d.ts files were generated from Closure `@typedefs`.\r\n\r\n## .js files ##\r\n\r\n.js files had more than 8000 `@typedef`, 7500 single `@typedefs`. The remaining typedefs fell into 4 categories:\r\n\r\n- embellishments for documentation or structure like `@summary`, `@description`, `@category`, `@public`, `@module`, `@global`, `@static`, `@interface`, `@example`, `@throws`. There was a lot of variety here.\r\n- 'local' typedefs that were immediately used with a `@param` and `@return` tag (the typedefs are not actually local to the declaration)\r\n- `@callback`-variants like the protobuf example above, which also used `@param` and `@return` tags. (and `@this`, once or twice)\r\n\r\n6 projects use the unsupported callback-like typedefs compared to 3 projects that use local typedefs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I observed plenty of unassociated `@typedef` comments that were not separated by a newline from the next element, though the median next element was another comment.\r\n\r\n## Analysis ##\r\n\r\nThe best rule for excluding typedefs in quickinfo is (1). Except for local typedefs, all typedef-containing comments that I saw were exclusively about that typedef. And, although both local typedefs and callback-like typedefs are rare, it's better to show a few callback-like typedefs than to hide local typedefs that were intentionally defined in-place. (2) won't work well because there it's too hard to capture the set of associated tags -- we would end up showing any unforeseen variants needlessly. And the data show that (3) is both unnecessary and ineffective.\r\n\r\nIn the future, if we decide to support callback-like typedefs, then (1) would stop incorrectly showing the callback-like typedefs. The code to implement this wouldn't be large, although I think there isn't much demand.\r\n\r\n[1] A full install of Definitely Typed, using @definitelytyped/dtslint-runner to `npm install` every package inside `types/`, then `find . -iname '*.ts'`.

I think the .d.ts files were generated from Closure . .js files .js files had more than 8000 , 7500 single . The remaining typedefs fell into 4 categories:  embellishments for documentation or structure like , , , , , , , , , . There was a lot of variety here. 'local' typedefs that were immediately used with a  and  tag (the typedefs are not actually local to the declaration) -variants like the protobuf example above, which also used  and  tags. (and , once or twice)  6 projects use the unsupported callback-like typedefs compared to 3 projects that use local typedefs. Additionally, I observed plenty of unassociated  comments that were not separated by a newline from the next element, though the median next element was another comment. Analysis The best rule for excluding typedefs in quickinfo is (1). Except for local typedefs, all typedef-containing comments that I saw were exclusively about that typedef. And, although both local typedefs and callback-like typedefs are rare, it's better to show a few callback-like typedefs than to hide local typedefs that were intentionally defined in-place. (2) won't work well because there it's too hard to capture the set of associated tags -- we would end up showing any unforeseen variants needlessly. And the data show that (3) is both unnecessary and ineffective. In the future, if we decide to support callback-like typedefs, then (1) would stop incorrectly showing the callback-like typedefs. The code to implement this wouldn't be large, although I think there isn't much demand. [1] A full install of Definitely Typed, using /dtslint-runner to  every package inside , then .
